         [6, 0, 0,    1, 9, 5,    0, 0, 0], 
         [0, 9, 8,    0, 0, 0,    0, 6, 0], 
         [8, 0, 0,    0, 6, 0,    0, 0, 3], 
         [4, 0, 0,    8, 0, 3,    0, 0, 1], 
         [7, 0, 0,    0, 2, 0,    0, 0, 6], 
         [0, 6, 0,    0, 0, 0,    2, 8, 0], 
         [0, 0, 0,    4, 1, 9,    0, 0, 5],
